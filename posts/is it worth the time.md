basic formula logic:
Goal: Save time on a recurring task.
Rule of Thumb: For a task done daily (N=1), you can spend up to 1 day (M=1 day) optimizing to save 1 minute (Z=1 min) over 5 years.
Example: If you do something daily, you can spend a whole day setting up a script to save just one minute each time, because over five years (1825 minutes saved), it balances out. 
The real xkcd punchline:
The comic's title text emphasizes that the time you spend analyzing this chart, reading the explanation, and questioning the math is also part of your life, creating an infinite loop of time-wasting calculation.
In essence: While the chart offers a rational framework, the real message is a humorous warning about getting lost in the meta-optimization, where the effort to save time ends up costing more time
